# sgkit-publication

This repo contains the manuscript for the publication describing sgkit.

## Writing process

Like the development of sgkit itself, the process of writing this
article is managed through an open source development model via
GitHub. Please follow these guidelines:

- For significant edits, please use the standard GitHub workflow
  of creating a fork, feature branch and pull request.

- For smaller edits, using the
  [edit file](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository)
  button on the paper.tex file in GitHub may be simpler than checking out
  the repo locally, etc.

- Please keep edits localised to a single section to make the
  review process simpler.

- Please insert line-breaks before 90-100 characters, ideally at semantic
  break points.

- For high-level/structural issues, please open an issue to discuss before making changes.

- When adding to the bibliography, please use Google Scholar's key format
  (e.g. `garud2015recent`), or preferably use Google Scholar's bibtex export
  (click the "cite" link for a particular paper, and the Bibtex option is on the
  bottom).
